    text: |
      Google Automated Discounts is a powerful feature in Google Merchant Center that allows you to showcase promotional pricing across your entire product catalog without manually updating individual prices.
      
      This feature helps increase your products' visibility in Google Shopping, improves click-through rates, and drives more qualified traffic to your store. When properly implemented, automated discounts can significantly boost your ROAS and overall advertising performance.
